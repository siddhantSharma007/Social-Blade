              <br>
              <p>
                Logical reasoning is a type of problem-solving that involves working through a set of rules that govern a scenario. This set of rules or steps is referred to as an algorithm. Logical reasoning involves testing different sets of steps - or algorithms - to determine which sequence of rules leads to the correct solution.
