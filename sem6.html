              <h3>Agile</h3>
              <p>
                What is Agile?
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

                Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, and even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind. From the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is a growing part of everyday life. As a result, many tech companies across various industries are investing in artificially intelligent technologies.

              <p>
                Coding, Decoding, and Reasoning are some of the most complex topics in the Reasoning section. This section is one of the most common sections included in all the major competitive exams dedicatedly designed for hiring processes and higher education. Many candidates find Coding-Decoding and Reasoning questions challenging to solve, and as a result, they avoid attempting these scoring questions and lose some easy and quick marks.
